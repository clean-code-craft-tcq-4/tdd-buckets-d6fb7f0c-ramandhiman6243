Input
A set of periodic current samples from a charging session, as an array of integers. For example: 3, 3, 5, 4, 10, 11, 12


Functionality
The continuous ranges in there are: 3,4,5 and 10,11,12.

The task is to detect the ranges and output the number of readings in each range.


In this example,

the 3-5 range has 4 readings
the 10-12 range has 3 readings.
Output
The expected output would be in comma-separated (csv format):


Range, Readings
3-5, 4
10-12, 3


Tests:
Check series for range and readings
Check whole continuous series
Check no consecutive series
Check empty series
